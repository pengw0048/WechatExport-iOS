# WechatExport-iOS
Save iOS WeChat history as HTML or TXT with neat layout and picture &amp; audio support.

The only open-source one-click application that parses the local database of Wechat, the most popular chatting app in China. This software bypasses the sandbox restriction recently introduced in iOS, and obtain Wechat app's data from an iTunes backup. It then links together data in SQLite files and various assets such as images, audios (format conversion involved), videos, etc. Users get a series of well-formated HTML files of their chat history, so that they can read later on any browsers.
